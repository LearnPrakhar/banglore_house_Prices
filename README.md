**Bangalore House Price Prediction**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a machine learning project that predicts house prices in Bangalore, India, based on various features such as location, size, and more. The goal is to provide accurate price estimates for real estate properties using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques.

**Project Overview**

The Bangalore House Price Prediction project uses historical data to train a machine learning model to predict house prices. This involves:

Data Collection: Utilizing a dataset with features related to real estate in Bangalore.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing trends, correlations, and outliers in the data.

Feature Engineering: Extracting useful features and encoding categorical variables.

Model Building: Training regression models to predict prices.

Evaluation: Measuring model performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

**Features**

The dataset includes the following features:

Location

Size

Total square feet

Price (dependent variable)
